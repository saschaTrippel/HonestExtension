    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>HonestExtension is an open-source Firefox add-on that aims to enhance users' understanding of the security and privacy risks associated with browser extensions. 
      It provides a unique browsing experience by tracking and presenting the user with their own browsing habits. 
      The add-on allows users to customize the permissions they want to track or select preset options that emulate popular add-ons.

      HonestExtension strictly prioritizes user privacy. 
      It saves data only on the user's computer and does not store sensitive information such as passwords. 
      Furthermore, the tracking feature can be easily turned off, and all data can be deleted at any time.
      
      Browser extensions have become essential tools for enhancing web browsing experiences, offering features like content blocking and shopping discounts. 
      However, extensions often require extensive permissions, which can lead to the collection of personal information, including browsing history and passwords. 
      Research has shown that users often underestimate the implications of granting certain permissions to extensions, leaving their security and privacy at risk. 
      Some extensions even leak personal information to third parties.
      
      With HonestExtension, our primary objective is to help users comprehend the security and privacy risks associated with browser extensions. 
      Upon installation, the extension gathers as much data as possible about the user's browsing habits and presents it to them. By visualizing the collected information, 
      we believe users will become more aware of the permissions they grant to browser extensions and the potential risks to their security and privacy.
